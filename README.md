# ULB OAuth

This repository holds the code for a OAuth service in front of the ULB intranet.

By trusting this service (and subsequently the ULB "intranet"),
this enables your app to authenticate users with their ULB netid and
gather some information about them (first and last names, email address, faculty, ...)

# Installation and deployment

This code is intended to be deployed only once
and be used as much as you want as an open service.

The reference deployment URL will be referenced here when available.

If you still wish to deploy your own (for development or you don't trust us ?),
you may follow the procedure in [INSTALL.md](.meta/INTALL.md)
